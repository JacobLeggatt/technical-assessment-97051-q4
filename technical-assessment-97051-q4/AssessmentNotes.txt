I created a powershell script to simplify the testing process called runmap.ps1. Since it is unsigned it's unlikely to run on a different pc, but I included it for completeness sake.

I only added one additional layer beyond the required - "Great Bear Rainforest Forest Management Area - Outlined". I added this because I noticed it was a subset of the "Special Protection Areas - All - Colour Filled" area and wanted to see how that would be displayed. I initially used the Colour Filled version of the Great Bear area as well, but then changed to the Outlined one so that it was evident what subset it actually covered.
